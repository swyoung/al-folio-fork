	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to positively impact library and archives collections and services—enhancing reference, instruction, metadata creation, recommendations, and more. However, AI also has ethical implications. This paper presents an extensive literature and review analysis that examines AI projects implemented in library and archives settings, asking the following research questions: RQ1: How is artificial intelligence being used in libraries and archives practice? RQ2: What ethical concerns are being identified and addressed during AI implementation in libraries and archives? The results of this literature review show that AI implementation is growing in libraries and archives and that practitioners are using AI for increasingly varied purposes. We found that AI implementation was most common in large, academic libraries. Materials used in AI projects usually involved digitized and born digital text and images, though materials also ranged to include web archives, electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), and maps. AI was most often used for metadata extraction and reference and research services. Just over half of the papers included in the literature review mentioned ethics or values related issues in their discussions of AI implementation in libraries and archives, and only one-third of all resources discussed ethical issues beyond technical issues of accuracy and human-in-the-loop. Case studies relating to AI in libraries and archives are on the rise, and we expect subsequent discussions of relevant ethics and values to follow suit, particularly growing in the areas of cost considerations, transparency, reliability, policy and guidelines, bias, social justice, user communities, privacy, consent, accessibility, and access. As AI comes into more common usage, it will benefit the library and archives professions to not only consider ethics when implementing local projects, but to publicly discuss these ethical considerations in shared documentation and publications.},

	abstract = {Librarians and archivists are often early adopters and experimenters with new technologies. Our field is also interested in critically engaging with technology, and we are well-positioned to be leaders in the slow and careful consideration of new technologies. Therefore, as librarians and archivists have begun using artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance library services, we also aim to interrogate the ethical issues that arise while using AI to enhance collection description and discovery and streamline reference services and teaching. The IMLS-funded Responsible AI in Libraries and Archives project aims to create resources that will help practitioners make ethical decisions when implementing AI in their work. The case studies in this special issue are one such resource. Seven overarching ethical issues come to light in these case studies—privacy, consent, accuracy, labor considerations, the digital divide, bias, and transparency. This introduction reviews each issue and describes strategies suggested by case study authors to reduce harms and mitigate these issues.},

	abstract = {This chapter describes practices of teaching privacy to undergraduate students in a credit-bearing context. The chapter features a discussion of a semester-long course, Information Ethics and Privacy in the Age of Big Data. This chapter opens by briefly outlining three points of consideration for approaching a semester-long course. We then highlight three assignments from the course that we think are particularly useful and adaptable for teaching privacy. We include excerpts from course materials and student feedback to illustrate specific points. The chapter concludes with a self-reflective assessment of our experience as teachers. We co-taught the course with a pedagogical viewpoint of learner-centered participation and trust, an approach that we have previously discussed in detail. The course was built around reflective and co-creative activities that make space for students to bring their own experiences and perspectives into the classroom, including self-evaluation, student-led discussion sessions, small-group discussions, creative activities, and hands-on projects. We intend for the assignments and topics of this chapter to be used beyond a credit-bearing context. Librarians teach in so many different contexts. With that in mind, we offer points of consideration for adapting our assignments for other settings, like workshops, one-shot instruction, or a sequence of course-embedded instruction to be completed over two or three class sessions.},

	shorttitle = {Knowing our value and our values},
	abstract = {"Assessment librarians make decisions every day about what data to collect, how to collect it, who to involve in the assessment, how to engage library users, how to account for social impacts, how to communicate results, and how to align with parent-entity expectations. These decisions are not straight-forward and often involve dilemmas or tensions among competing stakeholders. Knowing our Value and our Values: Toward An Ethical Practice of Library Assessment is based around a central question: how can decision-making be clarified by applying relevant values? To answer that question, a lens of practical ethics is applied, drawing from the professional values of library and information science. The book involves original research that investigates 1) the values that are relevant to assessment decision-making, and 2) how practitioners can put those values into practice to make ethical decisions about assessment. This research informs the design of a practical framework--introduced in this new book--that library assessment practitioners can apply to better discern and resolve ethical dilemmas in their work. The book contributes to the conversation around professional values and ethics in LIS, and ultimately presents a new practical model for ethical decision-making in library assessment"--From publisher},
